## Summary
This is a dashboard that helps save autonomous vehicle simulations. You can register a simulation type, adjust the configuration, save a simulation result and view all previous simulation results. To access the site you will need to register your user! It was mainly done for practice and learning purposes. The backend was done with Flask, SQLAlchemy, Graphql. Frontend was done with React. The user routes were developed in RESTful as well, but the Graphql implementation was used for the frontend.
